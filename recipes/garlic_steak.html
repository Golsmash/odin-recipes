    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 (12 ounce) New York strip steaks</li>
      <li>12 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
      <li>1 cup olive oil for frying</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons balsamid venigar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together garlic, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and black pepper in
        a small bowl until marinade is well combined; pour into a resealable
        plastic bag. Add steaks, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and
        seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine 12 garlic cloves and 1 cup olive oil in a small saucepan over
        low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is golden and
        tender, about 30 minutes. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>Remove steaks from the bag, wiping off excess marinade with paper towels. Discard marinade. Generously season steaks with salt and black pepper.</li>
      <li>Cook steaks on the preheated grill until slightly firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Remove steaks to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Drizzle balsamic vinegar over steaks, then spoon a few cloves of oil-roasted garlic on top.
